# Nigerian Sign Language Recognition with Deep Learning
This project aims to develop a sign language recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize different sign language alphabets.

#### -- Project Status: Done

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Model Deployment with Streamlit
* Data Modelling
* Computer Vision

### Technologies
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* OpenCV
* Streamlit

## Model
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to build the model. The model was trained on a primary dataset to recognize and classify images of nigerian sign language alphabets.
Refer to the document in [Featured Notebooks/Links](#featured)

## Usage
To use the model, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/tobaadesugba/ML-Deployment) to your local machine
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project (`cd tree/main/app`)
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run streamlitting.py`
5. Upload an image containing a sign language alphabet to the app
6. The app will then display the predicted alphabet in the image

## Model Performance
The model was trained on the dataset for 150 epochs, achieving an accuracy of 87% on the test set.
