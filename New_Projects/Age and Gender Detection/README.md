# Age and Gender Detection
This is an ongoing machine learning project aimed at detecting the age and gender of a person in an image or video using deep learning techniques.

#### -- Project Status: Suspended

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect the age and gender of a person in an image or video. The project will make use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and isolate the facial features of a person in the image. The isolated facial features will then be used to classify the age and gender of the person.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Dataset
The project will make use of publicly available datasets for training and testing the model. The dataset includes images of people of various ages and genders, and will be preprocessed before being used for training the model.

## Model Architecture
The model will be built using a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers. The model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset, and the performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Future Work
The current focus of the project is on building and training the model for image classification. However, the ultimate goal is to extend the model to perform age and gender detection on videos. Future work will involve exploring the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for video processing and analysis.

## Installation
To run the project, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and install the required packages using pip:
