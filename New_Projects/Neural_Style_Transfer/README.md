# Neural Style Transfer
This is a neural style transfer project that uses deep learning to compose one image in the style of another image.

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is build a system that allows the user to transfer the style of one image into another image. You can think of image as a custom image filter. The image is called a content image and the image whose style is to be copied is called the style image.

The user would be allowed to upload their own content image and style image. They can also use test images that aare provided by default if they just want to see the performance of the system.

This system can serve as a phot-editing application, that helps you to create a specific style you would like to see.
